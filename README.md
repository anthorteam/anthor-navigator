# Anthor Navigator

Routing and Navigation package.

## What

Anthor Navigator provides a simple and functional typed routing abstraction over Flutter navigator

## Concept

`AnthorNavigator` is a custom `Navigator`. It behaves just like a normal `Navigator`, but has several custom improvements and
features. It is engineered specially to work under nested scenarios, where you can have several Flows one inside another. `AnthorNavigator` is your main interface to interact with navigation by named routes, using `Navigator.of(context).pushNamed`.
